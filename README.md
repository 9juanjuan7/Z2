# Group work break-down strategy
Before starting to work on the project we got together to decide how we wanted to split the tasks in between ourselves. We first
separated everything that had to be done in to 4 and then randomly assigned to each group member as shown below:       
Member - Tasks        
1 - Phase 1, search for users (Juan)     
2- search tweets, refactor main function (Srivanth)    
3- search top users, compose tweet (Luis)     
4- search top tweets, refactor main function (Joao)
